# IBM HR Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using the IBM HR dataset. 
The goal is to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and provide 
data-driven insights to help organizations reduce attrition.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify factors affecting employee attrition
- Build machine learning models to predict attrition
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- SQL
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Insights
- Higher attrition observed among employees with low job satisfaction
- Monthly income and job role significantly influence attrition
- Employees with fewer years at the company show higher attrition rates

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📈 Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:
- Attrition rate by department
- Income vs attrition
- Job satisfaction trends

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/` – Dataset files
- `notebooks/` – EDA & ML notebooks
- `dashboard/` – Power BI files or screenshots

## ✅ Conclusion
The analysis provides actionable insights into employee attrition patterns and 
demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can support HR decision-making.
